# OscillaTroll
the more the better

If you ever felt that you didn't have enough oscillator then here is the solution!

The program has 10 oscillators and in every oscillator, the user can change the relative pitch, the gain, can use fm modulation, gain LFO and can change between three types of waveforms. Moreover, the program has an ADSR component, which can change the whole synthesizer's ADSR data.

After the downloading, you have to run the code and after a restart, your DAW's plugin manager hopefully will find it. 

This project uses Juce open-source cross-platform (juce.com).
